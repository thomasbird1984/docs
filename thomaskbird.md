# Focus
Create a website that is cool and fun, focused on presenting both sides of my personality. Creative vs. Tech.

## Process flow:
- Splash page
  - Divided in half vertically. A picture of me in an artistic setting with another picture in a more techy type of environment
    - In the center of the two pics I'll stand.
    - Each of the two pics will be split in half for one complete shot. 
    - I will featured half tech half artsy.
    - Either side will have some brief text and a link to enter either side of the site.
      - On click of the link the side clicked will slide over top of the other unclicked side revealing the entire image
        - possibly more text or at least a bit fuller text
- Second splash page
  - Tech
    - For now tech side will simply take them directly into the existing portfolio site
  - Artsy
    - TBD


## Things to do:
- Build portfolio
  - Building and landscape photography
