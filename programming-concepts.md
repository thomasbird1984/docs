## Programming Concepts

1. 3 click mindset
    -   Any task should only take 3 clicks to complete
2. DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
    -   Don't have repetitive code
3. Agile Methodology
    -   describes an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end users(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.
4. Lean
    -   is methodology focusing on optimizing efficiency and minimizing the waste of software applications during their design and creation. This methodology may be applied throughout an organization and involve all stakeholders in a software application's development and delivery.
5. TDD (Test Driven Development)
    -   is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and
6. Continous Integration
    - is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Grady Booch first named and proposed CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day â€“ perhaps as many as tens of times per day.
